# Activity-Retrieval-From-Videos

This was the project I did as my graduation project.
In this project, we successfully implemented and evaluated two state-of-the-art models, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DCNN) and Video Vision Transformers (ViViT), for activity recognition using the complex Kinetics400 dataset. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrated that while the 3DCNN model achieved a higher accuracy of 59.89% over 10 epochs compared to ViViT's 54.98%, the ViViT model was more efficient in terms of resource utilization, requiring significantly less GPU memory and training time. The results indicate that although 3DCNN generally performs better in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, the ViViT model shows competitive performance and resource efficiency, making it a viable alternative depending on the application requirements .
